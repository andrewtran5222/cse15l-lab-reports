# Lab Report 3
Welcome to CSE 15L Lab Report 3. This week we're dealing with servers. Yeah, real hackerman stuff. 

## Part 1
I set up the StringServer.java file to run on my computer at 'localhost:5222'. I input the link 'http://localhost:5222/add-message?s=hello', as seen at the top.

I did it again, but this time with the input link 'http://localhost:5222/add-message?s=hello%20again'
